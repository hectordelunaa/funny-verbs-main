# Funny Verbs
## A way to learn english verbs with a JS App

### == I'm still working on it, adding verbs ==

I had the idea of make a *funny way* to learn verbs, since my children was trying to _learn verbs_ in english because the high-school.

I was inspired in Apps like __Duolingo__ and sites like __freerice.com__ to create something that could help my sons.

First thing first, was the programming language, so I decided the simplest way and what I knew, so then I chose __javascript__ in a web environment only in a front-end way.

I've added more verbs!
